# RestraintTube

#restraint tube and top were designed by Maxwell Madden.
#Modified top was designed by Anthony Cole.

#'restraint tube (1).stl' contains 3D design of restraint tube used for restraining C57Bl/6J mice (and others of similar size). The tube requires a top to prevent mice from escaping.
#'top for restraint tube.stl' contains 3D design for a ring that can be inserted into the restraint tube and fastened with a standard thumb screw. These tops have a relatively short life time as the screw eventually causes the plastic to split or the plastic loses grip on screw.
#'modified top for restrain tubes (1).stl' contains design for a modified ring which allows for the insertion of a hex-drive threaded insert nut. This allows for better grip of the thumb screws and greater longevity of the top.
